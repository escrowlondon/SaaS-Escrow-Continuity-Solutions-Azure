[An Azure SaaS escrow](https://www.escrowlondon.com/microsoft-azure-escrow-services-for-business-continuity/) arrangement is a [3 party agreement](https://www.escrowlondon.com/download-software-escrow-agreement-templates/) between a developer, beneficiary and Escrow London. The developer is obliged to deposit all the components required to build and deploy an application hosted within Azure. These components may include source code, deployment scripts, databases and documentation. This deposit may be direct from GitHub or via SFTP. In the unlikely event that a developer is unable to support their software (ie bankruptcy), the deposited materials including source code may be released to the beneficiary following a legal process. There is also an option where Escrow London will maintain the AWS escrow environment for period of 90 days.
